# clicker-game
simple clicker game with a couple upgrades and an autoclicker  
not very fun or entertaining but I'm just messing around  

# Developper Mode
there's a developper mode locked with a password  
once unlocked, it displays every user/clicker interaction  
<sub>they are all logged to console aswell</sub>  
  
the developper mode also unlocks a reset button and possibly more cheat buttons in the future  
<sub>the developper mode password is: 1234</sub>
